### Initial Vision
Create a singular data resource for information about water resources in Chicago (or Chicagoland?), with the goal of increasing water mindfulness of her residents.  This includes open access to data, as well as various projects to use the data to tell stories about water in Chicago.  Topics can or may include:

1. CSO forecasting â€” using rain forecasts to predict if, when, and where a Combined Sewer Overflow will occur.
2. Rainfall patterns - a comprehensive look at our rainfall events, including frequency, duration, and intensity
3. Beaches - historical information about closures of beaches and conditions
